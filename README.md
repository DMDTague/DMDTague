### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Dylan**](https://www.dylantague.com), a data analyst based in Philadelphia, PA.

I dive into messy data and build tools that surface real answers.

If there's a question I don't understand, I pull datasets and won't stop until the insights are clear.

My main tech stack is **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Google Colab**. My favorite tools are Excel, Jupyter notebooks, and data visualization libraries.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [SEPTA Recovery Atlas](https://github.com/DMDTague/Septa-Dashboard), where I analyzed real-world transit data and user behavior patterns.

On my GitHub you'll see data analysis, AI experiments, and systems I build for myself.

I'm obsessed with understanding *why* something happens, not just *what* happened.

#### Fun Facts:

* I have two cats — **Leonard** and **Mac**
* I love chess, physics, and mathematics
* **Hobbies:** data visualization, creative writing, gaming
