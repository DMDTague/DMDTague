### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Dylan**](https://www.dylantague.com), a data analyst based in Philadelphia, PA.

I dive deep into messy data, clarify what matters, and build tools that surface real answers.  
If there’s a question I don’t understand, I pull datasets, dig through the noise, and won’t stop until the insights are clear.

My main stack is **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Google Colab**, plus experience building systems, running models locally, and exploring complex datasets.

Some of my favorite work includes the **SEPTA analysis project**, where I pulled real-world transit data and started breaking down user behavior, patterns, and system performance.  
On my GitHub you’ll see **three core repo themes**:  
- Data analysis & exploration  
- AI / model experiments  
- Systems, automation, and tooling I build for myself  

I'm obsessed with tracing problems all the way down, and understanding *why* something happens, not just *what* happened.

#### Fun Facts:

* I have two cats — my tuxedo cat named **Leonard**, (a fancy name for a fancy cat), and **Mac**, who I rescued as a kitten from a McDonald’s dumpster.
* I love chess, physics, and mathematics.
* I break things apart until I understand them — then I rebuild them better.
